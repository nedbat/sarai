    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    <p>I provide individual psychoanalytic psychotherapy to adults. I specialize in resolving long-term depression, calming anxiety, helping people find meaning in their lives, and living more in line with their values and ideals.  I have experience working with patients from all ethnic backgrounds, and with all age groups.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>I provide research consulting services in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, education, and nursing, having worked on both doctoral dissertations and funded grants.  I can help with developing a research question, organizing literature reviews, creating an experimental design, performing statistical analyses, written and graphical presentation of results, editing final products for APA style, and completing grant applications.</p>
